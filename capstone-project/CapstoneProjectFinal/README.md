Robot Control System

This script is designed to control a robot to perform certain tasks. It calculates the robot’s configuration and updates it based on a reference trajectory. The script also generates a plot of the error over time.
Dependencies

The script requires the following Python libraries:

    functions (a custom library)
    matplotlib.pyplot

How it works

The script first defines several transformation matrices and a robot configuration. The transformation matrices represent the initial and final configurations of the end-effector and the cube in the space frame. The robot configuration represents the configuration of the robot.

The main function is defined to perform the main operations. It takes in the initial and final configurations, the robot configuration, the current transformation matrix, the initial transformation matrix, and the proportional and integral gain matrices as inputs.

The function then generates a reference trajectory and loops through each trajectory to calculate the control input and error, update the robot configuration, and write the robot configuration and error to csv files. The function returns the error matrix.

Finally, the script plots the rotational and translational components of the error over time. The plot is saved as ‘X_err.png’ and displayed.
Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed. Make sure to adjust the transformation matrices and robot configuration as needed for your specific robot and task.
Output

The script generates a plot of the error over time, saved as ‘X_err.png’. It also writes the robot configuration and error at each step to ‘steps.csv’ and ‘error.csv’ files, respectively.
Note

This script is a basic implementation of a robot control system. Depending on the specific robot and task, you may need to adjust the transformation matrices, robot configuration, and gain matrices. You may also need to implement additional safety checks and control strategies. Always test the script in a safe environment before using it to control a real robot.
